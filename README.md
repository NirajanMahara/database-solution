## Security Best Practices

1. **Access Control**
   - Always use RLS policies
   - Never disable RLS
   - Use principle of least privilege

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Use secure functions for encryption/decryption
   - Regular security audits

3. **Authentication**
   - Use Supabase authentication
   - Implement proper session management
   - Regular token rotation

## Backup & Recovery

Supabase provides:
- Point-in-time recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Backup encryption

## Testing

1. **Security Testing**
   ```sql
   -- Test RLS policies
   BEGIN;
   SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
   SET LOCAL request.jwt.claim.sub TO 'user-id';
   -- Run your queries
   ROLLBACK;
   ```

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Check constraints
   - Unique constraints

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Query performance
